        <h2 style="padding: 10px; color: brown; ">Roast Levels</h2>
        <p>The degree of roasting significantly impacts flavor, acidity, and body.</p>
        
        <ul>

        <li>Light Roast</li>
        <p>Roasted the shortest amount of time, preserving the bean's original, bright, and fruity or floral flavors with high acidity</p>
        <li>Medium Roast</li>
        <P>A balanced option that offers a fuller body and a well-rounded flavor profile with notes of chocolate, caramel, and nuts, and moderate acidity.</P>
        <li>Dark Roast</li>
        <p>Roasted until oils surface, resulting in a bold, rich taste with low acidity and smoky or bittersweet notes, and a slightly lower caffeine content per volume</p>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h2 style="padding: 10px; color: chocolate;">Brewing Methods</h2>
        <p>Different methods extract flavors in distinct ways</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Drip/Pour-Over</li>
            <p>Hot water passes through a filter and grounds by gravity, yielding a clean, light-bodied cup that highlights delicate flavors.</p>
            <li>French Press</li>
            <p>Coffee grounds are steeped in hot water and then strained with a metal filter plunger, producing a rich, full-bodied coffee with more oils and sediment.</p>
            <li>Espresso</li>
            <p>Hot water is forced through fine grounds under high pressure, resulting in a concentrated shot with a layer of foam (crema).</p>
            <li>Cold Brew</li>
            <p>Coarse grounds are steeped in cold water for 12–24 hours, creating a smooth, low-acid concentrate that can be diluted</p>
        </ul>
